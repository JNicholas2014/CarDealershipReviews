A sample application to showcase Full-Stack development. 
The application is an Angular SPA. Features include: ASP.Net Core individual user authentication/authorization 
using .NetCore Identity, sorting/filtering using Angular Material modules, hosted via the Azure Cloud platform 
with resources such as Azure SQL DB

Idea for this application comes from EdX: https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:IBM+CAD0321EN+1T2021/home
I have reinterpreted the project to be hosted using Azure and Microsoft technologies in combination with 
Angular

Any name of a person within this application is also fictitious and does not represent views of that person(s), again
